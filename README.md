# High School Graduation Project

This repository contains the redesigned and recreated version of an outdated high school website, developed as a part of the high school graduation task. The project utilizes Gulp for task automation, SCSS for styling, and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity.

## Technologies Used
- Gulp: Gulp is used for automating repetitive tasks in the development workflow, such as compiling SCSS to CSS, minifying files, and optimizing images.
- SCSS: SCSS is used for styling the web pages, providing a more structured and efficient way to write CSS.
- Vanilla JavaScript: Vanilla JavaScript is used to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to the website without relying on any external libraries or frameworks.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to redesign and recreate an outdated high school website, improving its visual appeal, user experience, and performance. By leveraging modern web development techniques and technologies, the project aims to breathe new life into the existing website, making it more engaging and relevant to its audience.
